The basic idea of this app is to visualize the first 10 layers of a personâ€™s social connection sphere based on their closest 10 friends. To put it simply, the user has 10 friends and each of them have 10 friends as well and so on. The map shows the user where these people are and what level of connectivity they have to the user.
